//complete profile also need to be done via a link whenever a doctor is added by a hospital.
//so do we require to make a seperate route the profile comletion as everything is added by the hospital for the doctor.
// the only thing is he only need to verify himself that yes he is the one who is working there and also somehow the mapping of
the hospital and doctor required which is not mentioned int the models .... according to that models need to be corrected/updateed
